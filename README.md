# brucelib

WORK IN PROGRESS

A monorepo of libraries for developing cross-platform games, simulations and media-rich applications. Leveraging the [Zig programming language and toolchain](https://ziglang.org/), brucelib is designed to be hackable and can be used for rapid prototyping, game jams and fully-fledged products. Use only the bits you need.

"Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own‚Äù - Bruce Lee


## Features
- [ ] Platform abstraction for input, windowing, graphics context creation, audio playback, network and file system operations
- [ ] Cross-compilation from all major development environments to popular targets courtesy of Zig
- [ ] Hot-code reloading courtesy of Zig
- [ ] Game/sim state recording and playback API
- [ ] High-level "push" graphics API
- [ ] High-level audio playback API
- [ ] Immediate-mode GUI library
- [ ] 2D and 3D shapes library
- [ ] Linear alegebra library

## Supported platforms 
brucelib will support cross compilation to popular targets from all major development environments out-of-the-box but if your target is not supported it will be trivial to plug-in your own backend

Console backends are planned but will not provided by this repository. Access will be granted to registered NDA'd developers on request.
