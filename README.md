# BruceLib

WORK IN PROGRESS

A library of common primitives pertaining to the development of cross-platform games, simulations and media-rich applications. Leveraging the [Zig programming language and toolchain](https://ziglang.org/), BruceLib is designed to provide everything you need for rapid prototyping; in a modular, hackable way such that prototype code can be taken into production. Use only the bits you need.

"Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own‚Äù - Bruce Lee


## Features
- [ ] Platform abstraction for input, windowing, graphics context creation, audio playback, network and file system operations
- [ ] Cross-compilation from all major development environments to popular targets courtesy of Zig
- [ ] Hot-code reloading courtesy of Zig
- [ ] Game/sim state recording and playback API
- [ ] High-level "push" graphics API
- [ ] High-level audio playback API
- [ ] Immediate-mode GUI library
- [ ] 2D and 3D shapes library
- [ ] Linear alegebra library
- [ ] Noise functions


## Platform support matrix 
BruceLib will support cross compilation to popular targets from all major development environments out-of-the-box but if your target is not supported it will be trivial to plug-in your own backend

Console backends are planned but will not provided by this repository. Access will be granted to registered NDA'd developers on request.
