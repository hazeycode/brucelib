WORK IN PROGRESS

A monorepo of libraries (modules) for developing cross-platform games, simulations and media-rich applications. Leveraging the [Zig programming language and toolchain](https://ziglang.org/). Designed to be hackable and used for rapid prototyping, jams and fully-fledged products. Each module is can be used independently of or in concert with the others and each can be extended or modified to your specific needs.

## Modules
- `core`: minimal set of common types and functions used by other modules
- `platform`: platform abstraction for windowing, graphics context creation, input, audio playback, network and file system procedures
- `graphics`: push-style graphics API, abstracts low-level graphics backends
- `gui`: versatile gui library with an immediate-mode interface
- `audio`: audio mixing, synthesis and signal processsing
- `asset`: data-agnostic, graph-based asset system
- `asset-formats`: loading & saving routines for common asset formats
- `algo`: implmentations of commonly used algorithms in games and simulations
- `noise`: various noise functions


## Supported platforms 
Many modules have no system dependencies and will just work on many targets thanks to Zig's awesome portabilty. Platform support for the `platform` and `graphics` modules will be somewhat more limited and currently the planned scope of this project is to target all the popular native desktop, mobile and console platforms.

Console backends for the `platform` and `graphics` modules are planned but will not provided by this repository. Access will be granted to registered NDA'd developers on request.

Support for cross-compilation to all supported targets from popular dev environments is planned.
