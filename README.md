# brucelib

**WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS**

A monorepo of modules for developing cross-platform games, simulations and other applications. Leveraging the [Zig programming language and toolchain](https://ziglang.org/), brucelib intends to be highly hackable and suitable for rapid prototyping, jams or fully-fledged products. Each module can be used independently of, or in concert with the others and each can be extended or modified to your own specific needs.

### Modules
| Name | Description | Status |
| :--- | :---------- | :----- |
| build | Useful build and distribution packaging procedures to import into your build.zig | planned |
| core | Minimal set of common types and functions used by other modules | in-progress |
| platform | Platform abstraction for windowing, graphics context creation, input, audio playback, network and file system procedures | in-progress |
| graphics | Push-style graphics API, abstracts low-level graphics backends | in-progress |
| lmathz | Linear math operators, functions and transforms commonly used for 3d graphics | in-progress |
| gui | Versatile gui library with an immediate-mode interface | planned |
| audio | Audio mixing, synthesis and signal processsing | planned |
| asset | Data-agnostic, graph-based asset system | planned |
| algo | Implementations of commonly used algorithms in games and simulations | planned |
| noise | Various noise generators | planned |


### Platform support
Many modules have no system dependencies and will just work on many targets thanks to Zig's awesome portabilty. Platform support for the `platform` and `graphics` modules will be somewhat more limited and currently the planned scope of this project is to target all the popular "native" desktop, mobile and console platforms.

Console backends for the `platform` and `graphics` modules are planned but will not provided by this repository. Access will be granted to registered NDA'd developers on request.

Cross-building to all supported target platforms from popular dev environments is planned.

## Getting Started
- Copy/clone/submodule this respository
- Grab external libraries with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Build and run an example: e.g. `zig build run-example-001`
- Run the tests with `zig build test`
- Print all build targets with `zig build --help`
- Each module has a main.zig, i.e. `/{module_name}/main.zig`. Import in your source or add as a package in your build.zig
