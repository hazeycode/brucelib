# BruceLib

WORK IN PROGRESS

A library of common primitives pertaining to the development of cross-platform games, simulations and media-rich applications. Leveraging the [Zig programming language and toolchain](https://ziglang.org/), BruceLib is designed to provide everything you need for rapid prototyping; in a modular, hackable way such that a prototype can later be taken to production. Use only the bits you need.
